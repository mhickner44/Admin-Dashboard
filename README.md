# Admin-Dashboard
This is a dashboard page I created based off of this design file [Admin Dashboard](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png) 
 <br />

## What I learned
-Nuances of grid and how to establish layouts <br />
-Working with SVG images<br />
-When to not use react<br />
    -Attempted to add icons through react and learned that is not how it works but setup template pages and learned from that.
